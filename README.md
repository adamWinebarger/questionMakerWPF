# Questionmaker WPF Prototype

This is meant to be the desktop side of our project. Here the application will be responsible for creating new testers, generating questions for them, and then uploading that to the cloud firestore database

Once answers have been populated from the mobile app, this app will be able to pull those answers from the database, look at how answerers answered the different questions, and show percentages based on how many people of the group answered each question a specific way. It would also be ideal if we could set up some infographics to make that information more easily digestible.

## Still TODO:

- Create page for viewing all available testers within the database
- Create page that shows answers/answerers for each given tester
- Set up logic for showing percentage of each question answered
- Look into some infographic libraries for displaying answer information
